Make sure that MergeSort.h is present in current directory
To compile PartA.cpp, use command: g++ PartA.cpp
Once compiled, to execute PartA.cpp, use command: ./a.out

To compile PartB.cpp, use command: g++ PartB.cpp
Once compiled, to execute PartB.cpp, use command: ./a.out

Both programs assume that the read in file 'data1.txt' is available in the current directory
and both will output to out1.txt when ran.
This effectively overwrites any data that was previously in out1.txt.

out1.txt is formatted to be the same as data1.txt just printed in a sorted order.

Will work with line numbers up to 500 words; delimited by spaces.
