CSCE3110: Programming assignment 2
Author: Jeremy Kracy
EUID: jek0138

Make sure that BFS.h, mainBFS.cpp, and BFS.cpp are present in current directory
To compile PartA.cpp, use command: g++ *.cpp
Once compiled, to execute, use command: ./a.out

The program assumes that the read in file 'data2.txt' is available in the current directory
and will output to out2.txt when ran.
This effectively overwrites any data that was previously in out2.txt.

out2.txt is formatted to just state if the graph is connected or not.
The same output will be printed to the terminal

Will work with graphs up to 50 nodes
