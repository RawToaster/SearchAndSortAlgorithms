Make sure that HeapSort.h and HeapSort.cpp are present in current directory
To compile, use command: g++ *.cpp
Once compiled, to execute, use command: ./a.out

The program assumes that the read in file 'data3.txt' is available in the current directory
and will output to output3.txt when ran.
This effectively overwrites any data that was previously in output3.txt.

output3.txt is formatted to be similar to data3.txt just printed in a sorted order.

Will work with line numbers up to 100 numbers; delimited by spaces.
